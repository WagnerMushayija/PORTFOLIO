# Welcome to My GitHub Repo! 👋

Hey there! 👋 I'm Wagner Mushayija, and this is where all the magic **will** happen (eventually). Right now, it's a bit like an empty room, but I'm working on some cool projects that I'll be adding here soon!

## What's Coming?

Stay tuned! 🚀 I'll be sharing:
- **Exciting coding projects** 🖥️
- **Fun side experiments** ⚙️
- **Creative solutions** 💡 to problems you've never heard of.

In the meantime, here’s a little joke to keep you entertained:

> **Why do programmers prefer dark mode?**
> 
> Because the light attracts too many bugs! 🐛
